  Dearest dad; 
firstly I hope you have a great fathers day today. Secondly I hope that, despite having to do your job and manage with our burnt house, that 
your summer is relaxing. I am sorry that you are having to deal with not just the burnt house but also the insurance company/service master, who may not be 
managing  things very well. This whole ordeal really sucks but I hope that by the end of it we have learned some things and also that we have a brand new 
house, but of course I will only have about a year or two to enjoy it, because I'll be going off to college soon. When that happens I know I'll miss you
guys and I know I'll also wish I could stay at that house. By the way I have a few ideas for the new house. We should have a ping pong table somewhere, 
maybe a conservitory like I was talking about, plus an arcade machine. Even if we don't have this stuff, the house is gonna be amazing either way, because
you and mom are master house designers. Well, all in all I hope you have a nice rest of your fathers day and I hope that you can just take this day to rest
and relax because you deserve it. See you next week.
